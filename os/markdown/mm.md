## VMA

### `struct vm_area_struct *find_vma(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr)`

```c
/* Look up the first VMA which satisfies  addr < vm_end,  NULL if none. */
```
1. check vmachace first.
2. try to find from mm->mm_rb.rb_node
3. update vmcache.

### `struct vm_area_struct *  find_vma_prev(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr, struct vm_area_struct **pprev)`

Same as `find_vma`,  eut also return a pointer to the previous VMA in *pprev.  

!!! if addr > all vma-vm_end, return the pointer of vma with highest vm_end.  

### `struct page *_vm_normal_page(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long addr, pte_t pte, bool with_public_device)`

Gets the "struct page" assosicated withe a pte.("normal page")  :
1. `check_pfn`
2. `return pfn_to_page(pfn)`
For "special page", return null.

### `unsigned long do_mmap(struct file *file, unsigned long addr, unsigned long len, unsigned long prot, unsigned long flags, vm_flags_t vm_flags, unsigned long pgoff, unsigned long *populate, struct list_head *uf)`

### `unsigned long mmap_region(struct file *file, unsigned long addr,
		unsigned long len, vm_flags_t vm_flags, unsigned long pgoff,
		struct list_head *uf)`

## Page Table

### `static inline struct page *follow_page(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address, unsigned int foll_flags)`

1. 大页单独处理
2. `follow_page_mask`
3. `follow_p4d/pud/pmd_mask`
4. `follow_page_pte`

`pgd(global directory), p4d(4-level), pud(upper), pmd(middle), pte.`  

由此可见Linux采用五级页表，其中`p4d`可以折叠，变成四级页表。

## mmu_notifier

```c
/*
 * The notifier chains are protected by mmap_sem and/or the reverse map
 * semaphores. Notifier chains are only changed when all reverse maps and
 * the mmap_sem locks are taken.
 *
 * Therefore notifier chains can only be traversed when either
 *
 * 1. mmap_sem is held.
 * 2. One of the reverse map locks is held (i_mmap_rwsem or anon_vma->rwsem).
 * 3. No other concurrent thread can access the list (release)
 */
struct mmu_notifier {
	struct hlist_node hlist;
	const struct mmu_notifier_ops *ops;
};
```
`mmu_notifier_ops`注册了一系列回调函数，用于在CPU页表发生变化时通知其余子系统。
